Kitchen JS Font Based Icons

## Build Icons
```
node create.js
```
```
-----node build.js
```

## Use
Go to the fonts folder in the repo or in the root of the release version. Example html in index.html. kfi.js is not required but is a useful key value pair to get the hex values by icon name for use on things like an html5 canvas.
```
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="kfi.css" />
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="kfi.js" />
   
   <i class="kfi-badge"></i>
```
